## 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior
* Implement **RFM segmentation** using SQL
* Generate meaningful **customer segments** to support business decision-making
* Visualize insights through Power BI

The dataset consists of **2,824 records**, analyzed using **MySQL Workbench**.

## 🚦 Project Workflow

### 1. 📥 Data Import

* The [SAMPLE\_SALES\_DATA](https://github.com/Tanim-code/SQL-Project/blob/main/RFM%20segmentation%20for%20Sales%20data/SAMPLE_SALES_DATA.csv) file was imported into the `rfm_sales` database using the Excel to DB Import Tool.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Ensured correct date formats
* Removed duplicates and handled missing values
* Cleaned numeric fields for proper aggregation

### 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses included:

* Descriptive statistics of sales, quantity, and order frequency
* Trends over time
* Identifying top customers and products

**EDA SQL File:** [EDA Summary](https://github.com/Tanim-code/SQL-Project/blob/main/RFM%20segmentation%20for%20Sales%20data/Exploratory_Data_Analysis%20(EDA).sql)

### 4. 🧮 RFM Segmentation

The RFM logic was implemented using SQL views and subqueries:

* **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase
* **Frequency (F):** Number of orders per customer
* **Monetary (M):** Total sales per customer

Each RFM metric was scored from 1 to 5 using `NTILE(5)` window functions. Scores were concatenated and mapped to segments like:

* **Champions** (e.g., 555, 554, 545)
* **Loyal Customers**
* **Potential Loyalists**
* **Promising Customers**
* **Needs Attention**
* **About to Sleep**

**SQL File:** [RFM Segmentation SQL](https://github.com/Tanim-code/SQL-Project/blob/main/RFM%20segmentation%20for%20Sales%20data/RFM%20Segmentation%20in%20SQL.sql)

## 🔍 Results & Findings

### 📄 [EDA Summary](https://github.com/Tanim-code/SQL-Project/blob/main/RFM%20segmentation%20for%20Sales%20data/EDA%20Summary%20Result.pdf)

* Customers from North America dominate the dataset
* High revenue contributions from a small percentage of customers (Pareto principle)
* Monthly sales show seasonal patterns

### 🧩 [RFM Segmentation Highlights](https://github.com/Tanim-code/SQL-Project/blob/main/RFM%20segmentation%20for%20Sales%20data/RFM%20Segmentation%20Result%20summary.pdf)

* **Champions** contribute the most in terms of revenue and order volume
* **Promising Customers** have potential for loyalty programs
* **About to Sleep** and **Needs Attention** segments could be targeted for re-engagement

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used for customer segmentation via RFM analysis. By categorizing customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, businesses can:

* Personalize marketing strategies
* Improve customer retention
* Boost sales performance through targeted campaigns
